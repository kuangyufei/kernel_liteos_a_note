 * Name: fallocate
 *
 * Description:
 * The fallocate() function prepares or allocates a contiguous data area to the file.
 * Thus the write file is guaranteed be contiguous and no allocation delay until the
 * size reaches that size at least unless any other changes to the volume is performed.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * fp Pointer to the open file object.
 * mode Operation mode. only support FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE.
 * offset offset of the file to allocated.
 * len The size to allocate for the file.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  On success, allocate contiguous data area to the file . On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appro-
 *  priately:
